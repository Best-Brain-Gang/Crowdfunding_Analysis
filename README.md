# **Crowdfunding Analysis**
This project attempts to help project creators understand how to market their project on Kickstarter vs Indiegogo or other crowdfunding platforms. The purpose of this tool is to not only give them some advice on platforms but be able to efficiently market their project.

---
## **Technologies**
This project leverages python 3.7.9 with the following packages:
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) - For the analysis of crowdfunding data.

* [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - Used to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.

* [pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) - This was used to locate through the directory or file path. Also, it converts a string and converts that supplied string as a PosixPath that can be utilize by other functions such as reading or writing files to csv files.

* [csv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) - This was used to be able to read and write csv files easier and that each csv data are separated by a comma.

* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - For the visualization of crowdfunding data.

* [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/) - This provides the ability to work with arrays and use different mathematical calculations on arrays.

* [PyVizlot](https://pyviz.org/) -  Python visualization package that provides a single platform for accessing multiple visualization libraries. Two of the libraries are:

  * [plotly.express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/) - For the visualization of crowdfunding data.

  * [hvplot.pandas](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/user_guide/Introduction.html) - For the interactive visualization of the crowdfunding data.

* [Sqlalchemy version 1.3.20](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/sqlalchemy) - This is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.

* [Voil√†](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila) - This will allow us to view our Crowdfunding Analysis on the web browser.

* [Wordcloud](https://pypi.org/project/wordcloud/) - This will allow us to create a wordcloud data visualization technique that is used for representing text data. 

* [Plotnine](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html)- This is a data visualisation package for Python based on the grammar of graphics.

## **Installation Guide**
1. On the terminal, under the conda dev environment, install the following packages and dependencies before running the crowdfunding analysis tool:

  ```
    pip install pandas
    pip install plotly
    pip install hvplot
    pip install jupyterlab
    conda install -c pyviz hvplot
    conda list nodejs
    conda list sqlalchemy
    conda install -c conda-forge plotnine
    conda install -c conda-forge wordcloud

  ```
2. To show your crowdfunding analysis tool on your web browser, use `voila` command on the conda dev terminal and while on the correct directory of your crowdfunding analysis application:

    ```voila crowdfunding_analyzer.ipynb```
    * This will pop up on your web browser.

## **Usages**
1. Click the crowdfunding_questionary.py and type in the category of your project. So that you can check which platform would work for you better.

2. We use the crowdfunding_analyzer.ipynb to get the comparison on Kickstarter versus Indiegogo. It will show data visualization of each main category.
